# asp-net-core-web-api
A simple library for partial entity changes in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core.

In this repository I want to give a plain starting point at how to build a WebAPI with ASP.NET Core.

This repository contains a controller which is dealing with FoodItems. You can GET/POST/PUT/PATCH and DELETE them.

Hope this helps.
